Description: Implements fully Bayesian statistical inference and prediction using
    Gaussian Processes. Hopefully, the user will have the ability to fit and predict
    with a stationary Gaussian Process (GP) model, a non-stationary GP model, a 
    stationary composite GP model, and a non-stationary composite GP model. No
    guarantees on all those options.
